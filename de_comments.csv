The locks of the different doors are very special. We almost always needed 10 minutes to open the doors lent one had the feeling that one had the turtleneck in his hand and the key broke off slowly one should then clean and wash everything h use and mistk bel evacuate bedclothes pull off with which we have no problem anyway but then it would be fine if at least clean schw mmchen and geschirrt cher available for disposal would be very smelly so for the price we would at least let us have a clean accommodation awaits dear monica,,

80825, even if the trip went to america and i almost exclusively spoke english i will write this review for comfort in german and hope for the performance of the airbnb translator i had already spent a week in seattle when i came to betsy the contact and the communication before the arrival was fast and smooth on the evening of my arrival, she has received me friendly and I found her also very sympathetic the room is really beautiful and I have felt very comfortable in it although the bed is a bit short and I had a bit of trouble with my 1 82m betsy is a great host she prepared for me in the kitchen in the closet and in the bathroom so I could stow everything w lan internet was not a problem she even cooked me coffee every morning even though she does not even drink that is service the location is quiet but you can get to the bus quickly to get downtown by bus The nearest supermarket and the bus stop are only about 10 15 minutes away so it is something for everyone who enjoys a bit of peace but still wants to do something about the price is for German conditions quite high there but in America anyway I can not reckon with European standards as I had to learn I think that it is appropriate All in all, I really enjoyed my stay at Betsy and I can only recommend the accommodation for the time being   ,,
